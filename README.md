# Static-Comp-2

##  Static-comp-2 is a project to give me the best practise for html and css and implementing new skills that I learned untill now. It gave me an opportunity to explore css grid, flex and creating svg circles. It was a challenging job for me as I had to research about topics that I had not understood fully yet. This is still not fully functional webpage since there are still areas that I need to work and improve on. The main takeaways from this project was research skills and time management. 

## Main Features 
* Built using CSS Flex and Grid
* Includes SVG circles 
* Hover on nav-menus 

## Areas to Improve 
* Media Query 
* Usage of table 
* Alignment of some text areas 
* Proper usage of font awesome icons
